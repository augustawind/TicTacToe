Tic Tac Toe
===========
by Dustin Rohde
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is my first real program in Haskell, a 2-player game of Tic Tac Toe
played at the command prompt.

Possible future implementations include:

    * 1-player games versus computer AI.
    * Network games.
    * Graphical interface.

In doing this project I've learned a lot about functional problem
solving Haskell I/O, to name a few things, and I highly recommend doing
something like this for those in early stages of learning Haskell.
